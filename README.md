# Customer-Credit-Consumption-Prediction-Model

Goal: To predict future credit card consumption of customers based on their demographic and behavioral data, enabling better customer segmentation and targeted financial services.

Code: TrainDataFile.ipynb, TestDataFile.ipynb

Description: The dataset contains customer demographic information, historical credit and debit card transactions, liabilities, assets, and credit card consumption patterns over three months. The project involves data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a regression model to predict average credit card spend for the next three months. The model is validated using the RMSPE metric, and predictions are generated for customers with missing consumption values.

Skills: data cleaning, feature engineering, regression modeling, EDA, model evaluation, predictive analytics.

Technology: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

Results: A predictive model that estimates future credit card spending with minimized error (RMSPE). The results aid in customer profiling and strategic decision-making for personalized financial offerings.
